Hi, I’m Laury, an analytics engineer with experience in SQL, Python, dbt, and data analysis. 👋

I wanted to be a scientist or a detective, but data was more practical and faster. 😆

Before I learned SQL and data best practices, I an MSc in Physical Chemistry, worked in excellent labs in Porto and Paris as a student, and was a scientific writer for an innovation consulting firm.

During the COVID pandemic, I decided to dive into data, and I’ve never been happier in my work than I am today. 🙏

I gained experience as a full-stack data analyst in sports and entertainment for 1.5 years, then worked as an analytics engineer and data analyst for 1 year in an HR tech start-up.
Nowadays I am working as an analytics engineer II, transforming and modelling data using SQL, dbt, and low-code tools like Fivetran or Airbyte.

I enjoy coding in SQL and applying best data practices to collaborate with others and empower end users.

I thrive on breaking down complex data problems into small, solvable parts. 🤠

I believe in creating a fun and collaborative atmosphere at work. Outside of work, I enjoy relaxing with video games, music, and movies. 🍿
