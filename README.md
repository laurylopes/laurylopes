Hi, Iâ€™m Laury, an analytics engineer with experience in SQL, Python, dbt, and data analysis. ðŸ‘‹

I gained experience as a data analyst in sports and entertainment, then worked as an analytics engineer in an HR tech start-up, moved to London worked in a very small consultancy company as analytics engineer and now I am working as analytics eng in a marketplace company. 

I enjoy coding in SQL and applying best data practices to collaborate with others and empower end users.

I thrive on breaking down complex data problems into small, solvable parts. ðŸ¤ 

I believe in creating a fun and collaborative atmosphere at work. Outside of work, I enjoy attending concerts and exploring new restaurants.
