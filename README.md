Hi, I’m Laury, an analytics engineer with experience in SQL, Python, dbt, and data analysis. 

I gained experience as a data analyst in sports and entertainment, then worked as an analytics engineer in an HR tech start-up, moved to London worked in a very small consultancy company as analytics engineer and now I am working as analytics eng at Just Eat Takeaway.com.

I enjoy coding SQL and applying best data practices to collaborate with others.

I thrive on breaking down complex data problems into small, solvable parts. 🤠

I believe in creating a fun and collaborative atmosphere at work. 
Outside of work, I enjoy attending concerts and exploring new restaurants.
