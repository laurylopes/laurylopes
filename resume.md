As an analytics engineer with skills in SQL, dbt, Python, and data modeling, I am motivated by helping data consumers work faster and more autonomously in their analytical roles. With a background in scientific research, I switched to data during the pandemic and discovered a passion for modeling, coding, and sharing best data practices. I thrive on breaking down complex data problems into small, solvable parts.

## Expertise
SQL, dbt, git, ETL, data modeling, testing and documentation

## Experience

### Analytics Engineer @ Pinnu Analytics
**From Jan 2025 to present:** As an analytics engineer III, I specialise in transforming and modeling data using SQL, dbt, and extraction and load low-code tools like Fivetran and Airbyte. My role involves developing, testing, deploying and documenting modular analytical data models to ensure data flows accurately from the source to the end-users. <p>
**Techs:** SnowSQL, dbt (core & cloud), git, Fivetran, Airbyte, Lightdash

### Data Analyst @ Side by Randstad (temp work app)
**From July 2023 to July 2024:** I joined the business intelligence team during scale-up as an analytics engineer. I had the opportunity to explore, transform, load, and analyse hundreds of data models to support the product, sales, marketing, finance, and operations teams. Additionally, I was responsible for managing client-embedded analytics dashboards.

- Onboarding funnel: reduced by 35% the cost of verification of temp workers' documents. (tools: SQL, dbt, VScode, Looker)

- Performed Looker training sessions adapted to different technical levels: helped over 30 co-workers improve their skills and autonomy.

- Created and migrated SQL transformations into dbt: improved maintainability, testability, documentation and costs.
 
**Techs:** Looker, LookML, PostgreSQL, dbt, git, Airflow, Python, Zapier

### Full Stack Data Analyst @ Girondins de Bordeaux (football club)
**From Jan 2022 to June 2023:** I worked as the first data analyst at the club. From extracting to dashboarding, I had the chance to automate processes and build data models and dashboards to help sales, ticketing, marketing, and financial teams drive the business.

### Scientific Writer @ GAC group (innovation consulting)
**From Oct 2018 to Sept 2019:** I worked as a scientific writer, producing around 60 pages per week of official documents for tax deductions for major companies like Safran, Segula, OTIS, and Engie. This experience enhanced my ability to prioritize tasks and organize work efficiently.

### PhD student in Nanophysics @ CNRS (national scientific research center)
**From Sept 2017 to Aug 2018:** As a PhD student, I researched spintronics materials for next-generation electronics. This experience strengthened my analytical and problem solving skills, both essential for a career in data.
