As an analytics engineer with skills in SQL, dbt, Python, and data modeling, I am motivated by helping data consumers work faster and more autonomously in their analytical roles. With a background in scientific research, I switched to data during the pandemic and discovered a passion for modeling, coding, and sharing best data practices. I thrive on breaking down complex data problems into small, solvable parts.
