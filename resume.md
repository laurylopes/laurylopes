As an analytics engineer with skills in SQL, dbt, Python, and data modelling I am motivated by helping data users in organisations to work faster and autonomously in their analytical roles. With a background in scientific research, I switched to data during the pandemic and found a passion for modeling and coding. I thrive on breaking down complex data problems into small, solvable parts. 

## Expertise
SQL, dbt, git, ETL, ELT, data modelling, testing and documentation
