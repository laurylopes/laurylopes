Hi, 
I’m Laury, an analytics engineer with expertise in SQL, Python, dbt and data analysis. 👋 <br>
<br>
I started my career in physical chemistry, working in research and scientific writing but during the COVID-19 pandemic, I transitioned into data. <br>
<br>
First as a full-stack data analyst in sports and entertainment for 1.5 years, and then as an analytics engineer and data analyst for 1 year in a HR tech start-up. <br>
<br>
I like coding in SQL and to apply best data practices to work with other and empower end data users. <br> 
<br>
I thrive in desmanteling data problems into tiny solvable parts. <br>
<br>
I believe in creating a fun and collaborative atmosphere at work. Outside of work, I enjoy relaxing with video games, music, and movies. 🍿
